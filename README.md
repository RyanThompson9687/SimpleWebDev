Secure Software Engineering Project
Developer Name: Ryan Thompson
Project Title: Multi-Department Support Ticket System

Project Details:
This project was for the FL Polytechnic University course Secure Software Egnineering (CEN 4065).
The entire project was developed over the course of 1 week, with this being the first experience I had with web development. 
All techniques and languages used in this project were learned and implemented within the 1-week timeline. 

Project Description: 
This software is designed to provide a hub for basic users to create support tickets that can be viewed by and responded to by admin users. 
Users create an account with standard credentials (name, email, password), and those accounts can be either Basic or Admin.
When logged in, a user can view, create, and update tickets.
Each ticket is tagged to a specific department, has a status (submitted, in progress, requires follow-up, complete), and a description. 
A changelog is kept for each ticket, showing responses added by admin and basic users during the progress of the ticket.  

The software was a web-based application, accessed through a browser with internet access. The domain name was http://tempname.online (INACTIVE)
This domain is now inactive, however all source code can be found in this repository.
The software was built on a LAMP stack: using a Linux (Ubuntu 20.04) operating system, an Apache web server, a MySQL database, and the PHP programming language. 
The LAMP stack was hosted by Digital Ocean, and the domain name purchased through Name.com.
Visual Studio Code was used for all writing and editing of source code.

Programming languages used in the source code include PHP, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
The source code is organized in a file directory. 
A folder titled 'html' contains .html files, as well as 3 folders titled 'css', 'js', and 'LAMPAPI'.
The 'css' folder contains a .css file.
The 'js' folder contains a .js file.
The LAMPAPI folder contains .php files.
